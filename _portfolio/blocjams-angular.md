short-description: BlocJams is a music player built with AngularJS.

After building a [music player web application]({% portfolio_url blocjams.md %}) with HTML, CSS, and jQuery, I refactored it and produced BlocJams Angular, my first project built with AngularJS.

***

### Requirements
The requirements for this project were to refactor my original BlocJams project in AngularJS to make the application load quicker and to make it easier to manage and grow.

Because AngularJS and jQuery are both heavy source libraries, some of my scripts were refactored into vanilla JavaScript and Angular functionality to keep the application as light as possible.

### Conclusion
This project introduced me to AngularJS, and I have to say I really like the organized structure of this framework. If BlocJams were a larger application, there would be a more noticeable difference in page load speed between my original project and this one.
