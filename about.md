I'm Brandon, a web developer who loves Ruby on Rails and building useful and engaging web applications.

I'm open to new opportunites, wherever they may place me. Check out my [pre-development r&#233;sum&#233;]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resume.md %}) for a better understanding of where I've been, and read my blog posts to get a feel for where I'm going.

Be sure to check back here often. I'm working hard to build my portfolio and carve out a career in web development. I look forward to impressing you.
